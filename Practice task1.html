        My travel experience in Cox’s Bazar was truly unforgettable. The long, golden beach stretched endlessly, and the sound of the waves was calming. I enjoyed walking along the shore during sunset—it was a breathtaking sight. The sea breeze was refreshing, and the local seafood was delicious, especially the grilled fish. I visited Himchari and Inani Beach, both offering stunning views. The people were friendly and helpful. I also took many photos to capture the beauty of nature. This trip gave me peace and happiness. Cox’s Bazar is a perfect place for anyone looking to relax and enjoy natural beauty.
